# Release checklist (skill update)

- Frontmatter valid (name/description only).
- Any new template sections are reflected in the workflow in SKILL.md.
- Regression prompts run (spot-check at least #1, #4, #5, #8).
- Outcomes ↔ practice ↔ assessment alignment verified.
- Backlog updated with “shipped” note and success metric.
