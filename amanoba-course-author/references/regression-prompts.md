# Regression prompts (re-run after every change)

Run these prompts against the updated skill to ensure it still produces high-quality, actionable courses.

1. “Design a course spec for amanoba.com: [topic], [audience], [time budget]. Include measurable outcomes and a capstone.”
2. “Turn this student target into 8 measurable learning outcomes: [target]. Add evidence of mastery and common failure modes.”
3. “Propose a module plan that scaffolds from fundamentals to capstone. Include checkpoints and practice time estimates.”
4. “Write one lesson using the lesson template: include a worked example, Stop & Try, self-check with answers, common mistakes.”
5. “Create an assignment + rubric for module checkpoint #2. Define pass vs strong vs resubmission triggers.”
6. “Create a 10-question quiz with explanations that diagnose misunderstandings (not trivia).”
7. “Create a prerequisite diagnostic (10 tasks/questions) and map each miss to what to study next.”
8. “Student is stuck: [paste error/issue]. Provide a ‘getting unstuck’ checklist and a minimal help-request template.”
9. “Review this draft outline and identify hidden prerequisites, pacing issues, and outcome/assessment mismatches.”
10. “Write landing page copy: promise, who it’s for, outcomes, projects, prerequisites, FAQ.”
